SupplementaryMaterial
=====================

Supplementary material accompanying the study on "[Sequence Comparison in
Historical Linguistics](http://sequencecomparison.github.io)".

The supplementary material is subdivided into two main parts, the *benchmark*
part and the *results* part. In the benchmark part, you find all benchmark
databases which were created to test algorithms for automatic phonetic
alignment and automatic cognate detection. In the results part you find the
results of testing different algorithms on the benchmarks.

## Formats

The formats used for the benchmark and the results are rather straightforward
and easy to comprehend. A basic distinction is being made between formats for
phonetic alignment analyses and formats used to represent wordlists. While a
specific format is used for alignment analyses (the so-called MSA and PSA
formats), simple tab-delimited text-files are used for wordlists.  A more
thorough description of the formats can be found at:
http://lingpy.org/tutorial/formats.html,
and all files can be browsed at
